                <h3>üå± My Health Journey Reflection</h3>
                <p>Creating this health portfolio has been a transformative experience that has fundamentally changed how I approach wellness, nutrition, and physical activity. Here are my personal reflections on this journey.</p>

                    <h4>üìä Food Logging Experience</h4>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Keeping a food log was a joyful endeavor. Taking pics every time I have something to eat. Not only do I record what my body intakes, but I also slowly got to develop a good photography skill in a close up shot, for the foods to be looking more enticing he-he. On the other hand, making a physical log became a reflective time to me. Checking what I have done to be in this state, and knowing what things I can still do for the rest of the day. <em>Logging changed the lagging behind of my health üòâ.</em>"
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>The food logging process taught me mindfulness in eating. Before this project, I often ate without thinking about nutritional value or portion sizes. Now, I'm more conscious of what I consume and how it affects my energy levels and overall well-being.</p>

                    <h4>üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Physical Activity Insights</h4>
                    <p>As someone who spent most of my time reading and studying, incorporating regular physical activity was initially challenging. However, tracking my PE activities helped me realize that even small amounts of exercise can make a significant difference in my energy levels and mood.</p>
                    <p>The most surprising discovery was how much I enjoyed morning walks around the CPU campus. What started as a requirement became a cherished part of my daily routine that helps me clear my mind and prepare for the day ahead.</p>

                <div class="reflection-item">
                    <h4>üç≥ Cooking and Nutrition Awareness</h4>
                    <p>Learning to prepare healthy meals like the rice paper kimchi pancakes opened my eyes to the creative possibilities in healthy cooking. I discovered that nutritious food doesn't have to be boring or tasteless. The COSINA project taught me that cooking can be both fun and educational.</p>
                    <p>Understanding the nutritional benefits of different ingredients has made me more intentional about my food choices. I now look for ways to incorporate more vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains into my meals.</p>

                <div class="reflection-item">
                    <h4>üì¢ Health Advocacy Development</h4>
                    <p>Writing about healthier school canteens made me realize how much our environment influences our health choices. This project sparked my interest in health policy and advocacy, which I hope to explore further in my Political Science studies.</p>
                    <p>I've become more aware of the health challenges facing students and young people, and I feel motivated to be part of the solution through advocacy and education.</p>

                    <h4>üíª Technology and Health Integration</h4>
                    <p>Creating this digital portfolio taught me valuable technical skills while serving a meaningful purpose. I learned that technology can be a powerful tool for health tracking, education, and motivation when used thoughtfully.</p>
                    <p>The process of building this website from scratch gave me confidence in my ability to learn new skills and apply them to real-world challenges.</p>
