                <h3>ðŸ“š My Journey from Sedentary to Active</h3>
                <p>Hello! I'm Gabriel, a first-year Political Science student at WVSU. Like many students, I used to spend most of my time buried in books and academic materials. While I've always been passionate about reading and learning, I realized that my sedentary lifestyle was affecting my overall well-being.</p>
                
                <p>This health portfolio represents a significant turning point in my life. What started as a simple class requirement became a transformative journey toward better health and wellness. Through consistent food logging and physical activity tracking, I've developed habits that support both my academic performance and personal health goals.</p>

                <h3>ðŸŒ± Personal Growth & Development</h3>
                <p>Creating this website and maintaining these health logs has taught me valuable lessons about:</p>

                    <li><strong>Advocacy:</strong> Recognizing the importance of healthy environments</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Goals & Aspirations</h3>
                <p>As I continue my academic journey in Political Science, I'm committed to maintaining the healthy lifestyle habits I've developed. My goals include:</p>
                <ul class="goals-list">
                    <li>Continuing regular physical activity despite busy academic schedules</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>ðŸ’­ Personal Philosophy</h3>
                <blockquote class="philosophy-quote">
                    "Health is not just about what you're eating. It's also about what you're thinking and saying."
                </blockquote>
                <p>I believe that true wellness encompasses physical, mental, and social well-being. This portfolio reflects my commitment to a holistic approach to health that supports my academic success and personal growth.</p>
